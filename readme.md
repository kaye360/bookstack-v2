# BookStack version 2

Currently working on a custom API with a custom router. Yes I could just use Laravel but hey, this is more fun. I think.

The front end will be made with React.


TODO

- delete book
- limit recent activity on profile
- fix login/logout issues
- dashboard limit community feed
- make sure users cant give themselves notifications
- notification bubble doesnt show up right after login
- use proper response codes on api fails
- user auth on protected api routes
- home page
- about page
- try/catch all httpReq methods
- refresh library on add book


Future Feature Ideas
- currently reading
- list view for library
- library pagination
- live search library with debouncing
