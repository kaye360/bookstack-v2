# BookStack version 2

Currently working on a custom API with a custom router. Yes I could just use Laravel but hey, this is more fun. I think.

The front end will be made with React.


TODO

- make route to get 10 newest books added to db for Explore Component
- use proper response codes on api fails
- user auth on api routes
